**Rangka** (Malay for "framework" or "skeleton") is a powerful Laravel-based foundation framework from [Kitai Software](https://kitaisoftware.my), designed for rapidly building robust, scalable, and multi-tenant business applications. Rangka provides the essential building blocks and best practices, allowing developers to focus on unique application logic rather than repetitive setup.

## üöÄ Our Mission

At Kitai Software, we believe in building high-quality, impactful software that serves real business needs. Rangka is the backbone of our open-source strategy, enabling us to deliver diverse applications (like E-Invoicing, POS, and School Management Systems) efficiently and consistently, while empowering the community.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned/Coming Soon)

Rangka aims to provide battle-tested, reusable Laravel packages for common business application requirements, including:

* **Robust Authentication & Authorization:** Comprehensive user management, roles, and fine-grained permissions (RBAC/ABAC).
* **Seamless Multi-Tenancy:** Built-in support for securely isolating data and configurations for multiple clients/tenants.
* **Admin Panel Scaffolding:** Pre-built UI components for common administrative tasks (user management, settings).
* **Activity Logging & Audit Trails:** Track user actions and system changes for compliance and oversight.
* **Centralized Settings Management:** Global and tenant-specific configuration options.
* **API Standardization:** Consistent structure for API development.
* **And more...** (e.g., Notifications, Background Job Management)

## üì¶ How It Works

Rangka is designed as a collection of modular **Laravel packages**. Each core feature will be developed as a standalone Composer package, managed within this monorepo for cohesive development, and then published to Packagist.org for easy integration into your Laravel applications.

You will use Rangka by installing its individual packages via Composer into your Laravel projects.

## üí° Why Rangka?

* **Accelerated Development:** Start your projects with essential features already in place.
* **Consistency & Quality:** Enforce best practices and consistent architecture across all your applications.
* **Scalability for SaaS:** Built with multi-tenancy in mind, ideal for cloud-based business solutions.
* **Open Source & Community Driven:** Licensed under AGPLv3 to ensure transparency and encourage contributions back to the core.
